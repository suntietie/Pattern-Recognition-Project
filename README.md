# Pattern-Recognition-Project
Find best classifier for a hand posture dataset with 36 features and 6 classes, a thorough usage of pattern recognition / machine learning models

This is a final project for EE 559: Mathematical Pattern Recognition in 2020 spring semester
# Procedures
Data preprocessing, feature recombination, cross-validation, model training, model testing
# Best Accuracy
Support vector machine (SVM) based algorithm with optimal parameter is trained, leading to f1-score of 0.96 in testing dataset. 
# Models
* Naive Bayes
* Density Estimation based Bayes: K Nearest Neighbors
* SVM with kernel: radial based function / polynomial boundary
* Linear Classifier: perceptron
* Nerual Network: Multi-layer Perceptron
* Decision Tree
* Random Forest
# Other analysis
Feature reduction (PCA) and nested cross validation are fully analyzed in order to improve the accuracy for better model training, especially for k-nearest neighbors model
